# Lyapunov measure for State Transition Networks

The repository provides a method to construct State Transition Networks from discrete-time or quasi-continuous multivariate time-series.
Furthermore it contains an implementation of the Lyapunov measure defined for STNs (as introduced in [article link?]). 

## Constructing State Transition Networks


### Example 1 - STN from Lorenz dynamics

## Calculating the Lyapunov network measure

### Example 2 - Lyapunov measure of STNs from the Henon Map

### Example 3 - Lyapunov measure of STNs from the Lorenz system
